# this test is pretty stupid
# the trajectory is from a LJ systems but RMSD is computed from a peptide...
# anyway, it validates RMSD without NOPBC option since it gives results
# equivalent to these ones:
# WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0={ 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 18 19 20 21 22 }
# rmsd0:   RMSD TYPE=OPTIMAL REFERENCE=test0.pdb NOPBC

rmsd0:   RMSD TYPE=OPTIMAL REFERENCE=test0.pdb
