these four script can be useful to have indications of the convergence of a metadynamics simulations
1. the first can be used to generate the set of profiles
2. the second can be used to assess the difference in free energy between two regions (so assessing the homogeneity of the sampling)
3. the third can be used to assess the stability of the overall profile (so assessing the appearence of newly visited regions)
4. the fourth can be used to generate average profiles, assess their standard deviation and the differences between non-overlapping averaged profiles
