\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-1 The system

We consider the association/dissociation of NaCl in aqueous solution.
The dissociation barrier is expected to be around 2.5 \f$k_\mathrm{B} T\f$.
One interesting aspect of the ion dissociation problem is that collective
solvent motions play an important role in the transition.
This problem has been considered in the original metadynamics paper \cite metad
and also in reference \cite tps2 .
We will use the potential developed in ref.\ \cite Pettitt-JCP-1986 for NaCl and TIP3P water with
parameters corrected to be used with long-range Coulomb solvers \cite Price-JCP-2004.
The system contains 1 Na, 1 Cl, and 106 water molecules (total 320 atoms).

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-2 Perform an unbiased simulation and control the distance Na-Cl

We first perform a standard MD simulation and control the distance Na-Cl.
All the files needed for this example are contained in the folder Example1 .
The distance Na-Cl can be calculated in Plumed 2 using:
\plumedfile
d1:  DISTANCE ATOMS=319,320
\endplumedfile

The coordination number of Na with respect to O in water will also be calculated for later
use. This variable will represent the collective motion of the solvent.
\plumedfile

 GROUPB=1-318:3

 NLIST
 NL_CUTOFF=0.55
 NL_STRIDE=10
 LABEL=coord
... COORDINATION
\endplumedfile

To run LAMMPS you can use the run.sh script:
\verbatim

#!/bin/bash

############################################################################
# Definition of variables
############################################################################
EXE=lmp_mpi
totalCores=2
############################################################################

mpirun -np ${totalCores} ${EXE} < start.lmp > out.lmp

\endverbatim

This command runs LAMMPS using 2 MPI threads.
The use of partitions will be discussed when using multiple walkers

Once the simulation is launched, the so called COLVAR file is written. In this case it contains the following:
\verbatim
#! FIELDS time d1 coord
 0.200000 0.568067 5.506808
 0.400000 0.500148 4.994588
 0.600000 0.449778 4.931140
 0.800000 0.528272 5.105816
 1.000000 0.474371 5.089863
 1.200000 0.430620 5.091551
 1.400000 0.470374 4.993886
 1.600000 0.458768 4.940097
 1.800000 0.471886 4.952868
 2.000000 0.489058 4.897593
.
.
.
\endverbatim
If you plot the time (column 1) vs the distance (column 2), for instance in
gnuplot:
\verbatim
pl  "./COLVAR" u 1:2 w lp,
\endverbatim
you will see that the ion pair is stuck in the dissociated state during the 1 ns simulation.
It is unable to cross the \f$ \sim 5 k_\mathrm{B} T\f$ barrier located at a distance of approximately
 0.4 nm. You can also observe this behavior in the trajectory using VMD:
\verbatim
vmd out.dcd -psf nacl.psf
\endverbatim
The trajectory has been saved in unwrapped format in order to avoid bonds
stretching from one side to the box to the other due to periodic boundary
conditions. In VMD we can
wrap the atoms without breaking the bonds and show the box using the commands:
\verbatim
pbc wrap -compound res -all
pbc box
\endverbatim
You can play with different visualization styles and options that VMD has.
Therefore, if we want the system to go back and forth between the associated and
dissociated state, we will need enhanced sampling.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-3 Construct a bias potential on the distance Na-Cl

We now construct a bias potential \f$ V(\mathbf{s}) \f$ on the distance Na-Cl using well-tempered metadynamics.
The files for this example are contained in the directory Example2.
As argument for the construction of the potential we will use the distance Na-Cl (label d1).
We choose a gaussian height of 1 kJ/mol which is slightly less than 0.5 \f$k_\mathrm{B}
T \f$. The gaussian width is 0.02 nm, in the same order of the features in the
FES. A rule of thumb for choosing the gaussian width is to use the standard
deviation of the unbiased fluctuations of the CV. The bias factor is set to 5 since the largest barrier in the FES is
expected to be roughly 5 \f$k_\mathrm{B}T\f$. Once the metadynamics simulation is
converged, the bias will be (up to an arbitrary constant):
\f[
	V(\mathbf{s})= - \left ( 1- \frac{1}{\gamma} \right ) F(\mathbf{s})
\f]
and therefore the system will evolve under an effective free energy:
\f[
	\tilde{F}(\mathbf{s})=F(\mathbf{s})+V(\mathbf{s})=
\frac{F(\mathbf{s})}{\gamma},
\f]
that is to say, the largest barrier will be of around 1 \f$k_\mathrm{B} T\f$.
The input is:
\plumedfile
METAD ...
 LABEL=metad
 ARG=d1
 SIGMA=0.02
 HEIGHT=1.
 BIASFACTOR=5
 TEMP=300.0
 PACE=500
 GRID_MIN=0.2
 GRID_MAX=1.0
 GRID_BIN=300
 REWEIGHTING_NGRID=300
... METAD
\endplumedfile
Here the REWEIGHTING_NGRID keyword turns on the calculation of the
time dependent constant \f$ c(t) \f$ that we will use below when
reweighting the simulations.


We will also limit the exploration of the CV space by introducing an upper
wall bias \f$ V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) \f$:
\f[
 V_{wall}(s) = \kappa (s-s_0)^2 \mathrm{\: if \:} s>s_0 \mathrm{ \: and \:  0
\:  otherwise}.
\f]

The wall will focus the sampling in the most interesting region of the free
energy surface. The effect of this bias potential will have to be corrected later in order to calculate
 ensemble averages. The syntax in Plumed 2 is:
\plumedfile
UPPER_WALLS ...
 ARG=d1
 AT=0.6
 KAPPA=2000.0
 EXP=2
 EPS=1
 OFFSET=0.
 LABEL=uwall
... UPPER_WALLS
\endplumedfile

You can run the simulation with the run.sh script as done in the previous
example.

It is possible to try different bias factors to check the effect that it has on
the trajectory and the effective FES.

In principle the cost of a metadynamics simulation should increase as the
simulation progresses due to the need of adding an increasing number of
Gaussian kernels to calculate the bias. However, since a grid is used to build up the
bias this effect is not observed. You can check what happens if you do not use the
GRID_* keywords. Remember that the bins in the grid should be small enough to
describe the changes in the bias created by the Gaussian kernels. Normally a bin of
size \f$ \sigma / 5 \f$ (with \f$ \sigma \f$ the gaussian width) is small enough.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-4 Assess convergence

One way to identify if a well tempered metadynamics simulation has converged is observing the
estimated free energy surface at different times. The FES is estimated by
using the relation (again up to an arbitrary constant):
\f[
	F(\mathbf{s}) = - \left ( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \right ) V(\mathbf{s},t)
\f]
and the bias potential is calculated as a sum of Gaussian kernels.
This can be done with Plumed 2 using for instance:
\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills ../HILLS --min 0.1 --max 0.8 --bin 300 --stride 100
\endverbatim
Most of the flags are self explanatory. The flag --stride 100 will result in
the FES been written every 100 Gaussian kernels, i.e. 100 ps.
Inside the folder FES_calculation you will find a script run.sh that executes the sum_hills command and a gnuplot script plot.gpi that can be used typing:.
\verbatim
gnuplot plot.gpi
\endverbatim
After roughly 3 ns the free
 energy surface does not change significantly with time except for an immaterial
 constant \f$ c(t) \f$ that grows in time. This is in line with well-tempered metadynamics
asymptotic behavior:
\f[
	V(\mathbf{s},t)= - \left ( 1- \frac{1}{\gamma} \right ) F(\mathbf{s}) +
c(t).
\f]
The behavior of \f$ c(t) \f$ will be studied with greater detail later.
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-fesEvolution
\image html ves-lugano2017-metad_fesEvolution.png "Evolution of the estimated free energy"

It should be stressed that we are actually not calculating the free energy \f$ F(\mathbf{s}) \f$ but rather \f$ F(\mathbf{s})+V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) \f$.
For this reason for distances higher than 0.6 nm the free energy increases sharply.


An alternative way to observe the evolution of the bias is plotting the final
free energy plus the instantaneous bias.
The scripts for this example can be found in the folder Bias_calculation.
In this case we observe only the first 200 ps of the simulation.
The (negative) bias can be calculated using:
\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills ../HILLS --min 0.1 --max 0.8 --bin 300 --stride 10 --negbias
\endverbatim
This plot illustrates clearly how the bias is constructed to progressively "fill" the FES.
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-biasEvolution
\image html ves-lugano2017-metad_biasEvolution.png "Evolution of the bias potential"



It is also possible to track convergence by controlling the evolution of some
quantity connected to the free energy surface.
In this case we will calculate the dissociation barrier, e.g. the height of
the barrier that separates the associated state from the dissociated one.
The scripts for this example are found in the folder Barrier_calculation.
Using the python script calculate_barrier.py  we can compute the barrier, for instance:
\code{.py}
import numpy as np

# Total number of fes files in folder
total_files=101
# Min and max initial guesses
min_min=50
min_max=90
max_min=90
max_max=130

for i in range(total_files):
        file_name="fes_" + str(i) + ".dat"
        matrix=np.genfromtxt(file_name)
        minimum=np.amin(matrix[min_min:min_max,1])
        maximum=np.amax(matrix[max_min:max_max,1])
        print(str(i) + " " + str(minimum) + " " + str(maximum) + " " + str(maximum-minimum))
\endcode

The script can be executed using:
\verbatim
python barrier_calculation.py > barrier.txt
\endverbatim
and the results can be plotted using the gnuplot script plot.gpi.
After roughly 4 ns the barrier stabilizes around 3 and 3.5 \f$k_\mathrm{B} T\f$.
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-barrier
\image html ves-lugano2017-metad_barrier.png "Dissociation barrier as a function of simulation time"

It is important to stress that it is only possible to calculate the free energy difference
between two points if the system has gone back and forth
between these points several times. This applies both for the calculation of a
barrier and the difference in free energy between two basins. It is also
important to understand that none of the free energy methods described in this
series of tutorials  will be able to calculate
free energies of regions that have not been sampled, i.e. visited.

Reweighting the simulation on the same CV that was used for biasing can also
be used as a test of convergence. We will show that in the next section.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-5 Reweight the simulation

We first reweight the simulation on the distance Na-Cl, the same CV used for
biasing.
This reweighting is useful to check convergence and to
have an estimate of the free energy that does not rely on using kernels. For
instance if some features of the FES could not be captured by the kernels, the
reweighting procedure will show them. This will become clearer in the VES
tutorial.
The scripts to perform this calculation are found in the folder ReweightDistance.
In metadynamics quasi-stationary limit the weight assigned to a given
configuration is \cite Tiwary_jp504920s :
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta ( V(\mathbf{s},t) - c(t) )}.
\f]
By plotting time (column 1) versus \f$ c(t) \f$ (column 6) using the COLVAR
file, the importance of taking \f$ c(t) \f$ into account
becomes clear.
 \f$ c(t) \f$ keeps growing even after long times, reflecting the
approximately rigid shift of the bias with time.
Normally the first part of the trajectory is not used for reweighting since
during this period the simulation has not reached the quasi-stationary limit.
In this case we can discard the first 2 or 3 ns of simulation.
To disregard the first 3 ns of simulation we can use sed to delete the first 15000 lines from the COLVAR file:
\verbatim
sed '2,15000d' ../COLVAR > COLVAR
\endverbatim

We then use Plumed to calculate two histograms, one taking into account the wall bias and the other one neglecting it.
The weights for the reweighting involving only the metadynamics bias have
already been discussed while the weights considering both biases are:
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta ( V(\mathbf{s},t) - c(t) +
V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) )}.
\f]
The input script for Plumed is:
\plumedfile
# Read COLVAR file
distance:       READ FILE=COLVAR  IGNORE_TIME VALUES=d1
metad:       READ FILE=COLVAR IGNORE_TIME VALUES=metad.rbias
uwall:       READ FILE=COLVAR IGNORE_TIME VALUES=uwall.bias

# Define weights
weights1: REWEIGHT_METAD TEMP=300
weights2: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=300 ARG=metad.rbias,uwall.bias

# Calculate histograms
HISTOGRAM ...
  ARG=distance
  GRID_MIN=0.2
  GRID_MAX=0.8
  GRID_BIN=100
  BANDWIDTH=0.002
  LOGWEIGHTS=weights1
  LABEL=hh1
... HISTOGRAM

  GRID_MIN=0.2

  GRID_BIN=100

  LABEL=hh2
... HISTOGRAM

# Print histograms to file
DUMPGRID GRID=hh1 FILE=histo FMT=%24.16e
DUMPGRID GRID=hh2 FILE=histo_wall FMT=%24.16e
\endplumedfile

This example can be run with:
\verbatim
plumed --no-mpi driver --plumed plumed.dat --noatoms > plumed.out
\endverbatim
and will generate the files histo and histo_wall.
The histograms represent the probability \f$p(\mathbf{s})\f$ of observing a
given value of the CV \f$ \mathbf{s} \f$ .
From the histograms the FES can be calculated using:
\f[
\beta F(\mathbf{s})= - \log p(\mathbf{s})
\f]
and therefore we plot the FES in gnuplot using for instance:
\verbatim
pl  "./histo" u 1:(-log($2)) w lp
\endverbatim

The next plot compares the estimations of the FES from sum_hills,
reweighting with metadynamics bias, and reweighting using both the metadynamics bias and the upper wall bias
You will find a gnuplot script plot.gpi to make this plot inside the ReweightDistance folder.

\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-reweightDist
\image html ves-lugano2017-metad_reweightDist.png "FES estimated from sum_hills, reweighting using only the metadynamics bias, and reweighting using both the metadynamics bias and the upper wall bias"

We can obtain important information of the system by reweighting on 2 CVs: The
distance Na-Cl and the coordination of Na with O.
This reweighting is similar to the one already done and the files that you will need are located in the ReweightBoth folder.
Additionally the COLVAR file with the omitted first steps is required.
The plot of the FES as a function of these 2 CVs provides important
information of the association/dissociation mechanism. In the
dissociated state, Na can have a coordination of 5 or 6, though it is more
likely to find a coordination number of 6. However, in order to associate Na
must have a coordination with O of 5. In the associated state Na can have a
coordination of 3, 4 or 5. The transition state is characterized by a
coordination number of ~5.

\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-reweightBoth
\image html ves-lugano2017-metad_reweightBoth.png "Free energy as a function of distance Na-Cl and the coordination number of Na and O."


\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-6 Construct a bias potential on the coordination Na-O

As an exercise, you can write the input files for a simulation in which a bias
potential is constructed on the coordination Na-0, i.e. the solvent degree of
freedom. You can use the same gaussian height as before and \f$ \sigma = 0.1
\f$.

You will find that the exploration of the CV space is not efficient.
The reason is that there is a slow degree of freedom that it is not being biased: the distance Na-Cl.
Furthermore you can see in the 2 CV reweighting that the coordination Na-O
shows significant overlap between the associated and dissociated states.

Bear in mind that this is a rather trivial example since the existing barriers are
relatively low. Real problems in materials science usually involve large barriers
and are not as forgiving as this example; a bad CV may lead to huge hysteresis
and problems in convergence.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-7 Construct a bias potential on both CVs

We will now construct a bias potential on both CVs.
We have already calculated the FES as a function of both CVs through
reweighting.
In this example the FES will be calculated using the metadynamics bias
potential.
You can use the input files from Example2.tar and changed the plumed.dat file.
To construct a 2 dimensional bias with metadynamics use the following
input:
\plumedfile
METAD ...
 LABEL=metad
 ARG=d1,coord
 SIGMA=0.02,0.1
 HEIGHT=1.
 BIASFACTOR=5
 TEMP=300.0
 PACE=500
 GRID_MIN=0.15,2.
 GRID_MAX=0.9,9.
 GRID_BIN=400,400
 REWEIGHTING_NGRID=400,400
... METAD
\endplumedfile

Once that the simulation is completed you can run plumed sum_hills to
calculate the FES:
\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS --mintozero
\endverbatim
and plot the results using the following lines in gnuplot:
\verbatim
set pm3d map
set zr [0:15]
spl "fes.dat" u 1:2:3
\endverbatim
\section ves-lugano2017-metad-final Final remarks

Some valuable tools for metadynamics simulations will be discussed in the VES
tutorial. These include:

- Restarting a simulation.
- Using Plumed driver to calculate a CV that was not calculated during the
  simulation. A reweighting can then be performed on this CV.
- Constructing biased histograms, i.e. histograms without weights to calculate
  the effective FES \f$ \tilde{F}(\mathbf{s}) = F(\mathbf{s}) + V(\mathbf{s}) \f$.
- Use multiple walkers to improve the exploration of CV space.
