Running:
	> python martiniFormFactor_p3.py -f start.pdb -dat SASDAB7.dat -unit nm
results in the following ouput files:
	aacg_template.pdb
	plumed.dat
	plumed_beads.dat

The file plumed_AACG.dat is a plumed file for computing intensities with both atomistic and coarse-grain approaches, as described in the tutorial.


In OutputFromPDB the are the output files, obtained running:
	> plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_pdb start.pdb 
	> plumed driver --plumed plumed_AACG.dat --mf_pdb start.pdb 

In OutputFromXTC the are the output files, obtained running:
	> plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_xtc samplextc.xtc 
	> plumed driver --plumed plumed_AACG.dat --mf_xtc samplextc.xtc
